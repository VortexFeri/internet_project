# Portfolio Website mockup

This is my first year's final project for the Internet course. It is a mockup portfolio website made up of 4 different pages, showcasing some of my work.
It has a dark/light mode switcher as well as a color theme switcher, Those themes preserve their values in cookies if the project is opened on a local server.

## Installation
Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.

Open the terminal and run:
```powershell
npm install
```

To start the server:
```powershell
npm start
```
To visit the app:
```
localhost:3000/index.html
```

## Open without installation

If you want to open the public version of the project instead of the developement one, you can just download the latest release and open `index.html`.

This is the compiled version with a single, regular CSS file, auto-generated from all the partial SCSS files.

**Note!** browsers don't save cookies on local files, so in order for the dark-mode switcher and accent color picker to save their status, you wouldd need to open them using Live Server in VS Code.
